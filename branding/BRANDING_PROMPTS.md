# SynapseInbox Branding Prompts

**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for SynapseInbox following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy).

The main visual should feature an organized inbox or message center interface with filtering capabilities. Show glowing message cards or envelopes in different colors representing priorities (red for urgent, blue for normal, green for low). Include visual elements like search bars, filter icons, and unread counters. Add subtle circuit patterns connecting the messages.

Include the text "SynapseInbox" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Inbox Management for AI Agents" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and priority colors (red #ff4444 for urgent, blue #60a5fa for normal, green #4ade80 for low). Add elements like mail/envelope icons, search magnifying glass, filter funnels, and a clean grid layout.

The overall mood should be organized, searchable, and efficient - conveying message management and inbox control.
```

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for a message inbox management system called SynapseInbox.

The design should feature a stylized inbox or mailbox icon with filter/search indicators. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist inbox tray with layered messages or envelopes, and include small icons suggesting filtering (funnel) or search (magnifying glass).

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the main inbox icon, with small colored dots or indicators for different priority messages (red, blue, green). Add a subtle glow effect around the icon and maybe small sparkles or light rays suggesting "smart" filtering.

The style should be modern, clean, and tech-forward - suitable for a professional AI communication tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for SynapseInbox.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of an inbox or message center with filter indicators - perhaps a inbox tray with layered messages and a small magnifying glass or filter funnel icon.

In the center and right sections, display "SynapseInbox" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like message threads, connection lines, or a faint grid. The icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan.

Below or integrated with the text, add small priority indicators (colored dots) or a subtle search/filter visual to reinforce the "inbox management" concept.

Professional, clean, tech-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for SynapseInbox that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring an inbox tray or envelope with a filter/search indicator. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be a simple, geometric inbox tray with 2-3 layered messages inside, and a small magnifying glass or filter funnel in the corner.

Use white for the main icon elements with small accent dots in priority colors (red, blue, green) on the messages.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as an inbox/message management tool.
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
1. Forge requested this as extension to SynapseLink for advanced message management
2. The design should emphasize filtering, search, and organization
3. All images should work well on dark backgrounds (GitHub)
4. Maintain consistency with other Beacon HQ tools (tech-forward aesthetic)
5. Related to SynapseLink but distinct - this is about MANAGING messages, not sending them
